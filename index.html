    Hi! I am a 19 year old student currently studying physics at 
    <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu" target="_blank">Grinnell College</a>. 
    I am a lover of physics, photography, data, maps, urban planning, and design. 
    My interests and passions are all over the place, but I am consistently 
    fascinated by the ways in which we can represent the world around us, whether 
    mathemacially or artistically. 
    My goal with this website is to have a platform to exhibit the projects I work on 
    and determine where and how they overlap. 
    <br><br>
    You can find a copy of my r&eacute;sum&eacute; <a href='resume/resume.pdf'>here</a>. 
    You can also find more detailed information about projects I have worked on <a href='projects.html'>here</a>.
