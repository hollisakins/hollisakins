    Hi! I am a 19 year old physicist, photographer, math & computer nerd, appreciator of 
    good weather, and full-time student currently studying physics at 
    <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu" target="_blank">Grinnell College</a>. 
    I find that my interests and passions are all over the place, and my goal with this 
    website is to have a 
    platform to exhibit the projects I work on and determine where they overlap. 
    <br/>
    You can find a copy of my r&eacute;sum&eacute; is <a href='resume/resume.pdf'>here</a>. 
    You can also find more detailed information about projects I have worked on <a href='projects.html'>here</a>.
