        For my final project for an observational astronomy class at Guilford College, I used a method called <i>Lucky Imaging</i> to photograph
        planets and incoorporate them into artistic photographs. The project was exhibited as a <a href='poster2.pdf'>poster presentation</a> at the Guilford Undergraduate 
        Symposium, and turned into an <a href='astro_oct.pdf'>article</a> which was published in the October 2018 edition of <i>The Physics Teacher</i>.
