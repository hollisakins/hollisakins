        I worked as a Research Assistant at the Guilford College Cline Observatory in the summer of 2018, 
        studying variable stars and constructing a system for automatic data analysis and collection. 
        The project was intended primarily to facilitate future student research using the tools I developed.

        While the nature of the project did not necessitate a final research paper or presentation, I am compiling a summary 
        of the work I did and the preliminary results obtained. That document will be available here soon.
        <!-- You can see that document <a href='report/report.pdf'>here</a>. -->

        For my final project for an observational astronomy class at Guilford College, 
        I used a method called <i>Lucky Imaging</i> to photograph
        planets and incoorporate them into artistic photographs. The project was 
        exhibited as a <a href='poster2.pdf'>poster presentation</a> at the Guilford Undergraduate 
        Symposium, and turned into an <a href='astro_oct.pdf'>article</a> which was 
        published in the October 2018 edition of <i>The Physics Teacher</i>.

        While not a full-fledged research project, I have used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software to
        study the impacts of urban sprawl on developing cities. This was a final project for a GIS class at Guilford College, 
        completed over three weeks in the fall of 2018. The final paper can be found <a href='gis.pdf'>here</a>.

        In the Spring of 2018, I worked with a team of fellow students at the Early College at Guilford to complete the 
        SIAM Mathworks Math Modelling Challenge, a 14-hour long math competition. We developed a model to address food waste in the
        U.S. and submitted a paper which won Honerable Mention in the competition. The final paper can be seen <a href='m32018.pdf'>here</a>.
