    about me!

<div class="article">
<p> 
    Hi! I am a 19 year old physicist, photographer, math & computer nerd, appreciator of 
    good weather, and full-time student currently studying physics at 
    <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu" target="_blank">Grinnell College</a>. 
    I find that my interests and passions are all over the place, and my goal with this 
    website is to have a 
    platform to exhibit the projects I work on and determine where they overlap. 
</p><p>
    My interest in Physics was born during my time at <a href="http://www.guilford.edu" target="_blank">Guilford College</a> 
    through a dual-enrollement program. There I had the opportunity to explore
    the way the universe works through theoretical, experimental, and computational physics, 
    and was lucky enough to experience the joys of <a href="astrophotography.html" target="_blank">observational astronomy</a>.
    I also spent my time at Guilford exploring my interests in other fields, including 
    <a href="perspectives.html" target="_blank">photography</a>, geography, and design. 

    Outside of Physics, my intellectual curiosities hover around the ways in which humans interact
    with our society. Architecture, design, and urban planning have long been interests of mine, and I 
    hope to get to explore these topics more in my time at Grinnell.

    I also have a passion for information design; some of the schoolwork I am most pleased with 
    can be seen <a href="" taret="_blank">here</a>.

    <!-- I hope that this website will help me to develop my wide variety of interests and understand 
    where they all intersect, as well as help others understand what my passions are and how 
    I interact with the world. -->
</p>
