<div class="article">
<p> 
    Hi! I am a 19 year old physicist, photographer, math & computer nerd, appreciator of 
    good weather, and full-time student 
    currently studying physics at <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu" target="_blank">Grinnell College</a>. 
    I find that my interests and passions are all over the place, and my goal with this 
    website is to have a 
    platform to exhibit the projects I work on and determine where they overlap. 
</p><p>
    My interest in Physics was born during my time at <a href="http://www.guilford.edu" target="_blank">Guilford College</a> 
    through a dual-enrollement program. 
    <!-- Photography has been my major artistic medium 
    since 2013. The ability of a camera to capture moments, and the ability of the photographer 
    to capture and create feelings and moods has always intrigued me. Photography has always 
    been a perfect blend between technical and creative skills for me. I have explored digital 
    photography and Photoshop, as well as film photography and silver-gelatin printing. Most of 
    my photographic work is surreal, as my fascination has always been with representing the 
    world in unique and unusual ways.  -->
</p><p>
    <!-- My other interests lie in science, math, physics, and 
    computer science, and I have been exploring these disciplines in many ways. I have taken 
    physics courses for two years, learning everything from electromagnetism to general 
    relativity. I have taken calculus courses and applied my knowledge in national mathematical 
    modeling competitions. I have implemented computer programming as a tool throughout many 
    parts of my life, and explored the wonderful possibilities that computers yield. These are 
    all incredibly interesting to me, and I hope to continue to explore these disciplines.  -->

    <!-- I hope that this website will help me to develop my wide variety of interests and understand 
    where they all intersect, as well as help others understand what my passions are and how 
    I interact with the world. -->
</p>
